## About:
DoptaDog seeks to make pet adoption simpler and more enjoyable. Users can search for a specific dog by location and type, and users who are not sure of their preferences can 'shuffle' through all pets in the Petfinder database to spark ideas. One-click 'Save to Favorites' allows users to keep track of their top choices (localStorage) before selecting a new pup to join their family.

## Tech Stack:
- Javascript
  - React
  - Redux
  - React Router
- Styling
  - Stylus
- Setup
  - Webpack + Babel
  - Node.js local server
- Hosting
  - Heroku

## Data:
- Petfinder API

## Future builds:
- 'My Preferences' page which holds statistics on a user's preferences based on dogs which were added to 'My favorites' (e.g. "My favorite breeds")
- Social share for each dog (email, Facebook)
- User sign-in and connection to database to save favorites (rather than localStorage)
